# Wine Quality Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **Wine Quality dataset** and builds machine learning models to predict wine quality scores. The workflow includes **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling using various classifiers.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Explore and understand the dataset using **EDA**.  
- Visualize correlations between chemical properties and wine quality.  
- Perform **feature engineering and transformation**.  
- Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict wine quality.
